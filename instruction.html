<p>
In this task, you will do the following steps: (1) read tweets that are relevant to GUN issues, (2) decide
whether a tweet is associated with <strong><i>Care/Harm</i></strong>, and rate your confidence levels for this
decision, and (3) decide how the tweet is associated with <strong><i>Care/Harm</i></strong> -- Care only, 
Harm only, or Both Care &amp; Harm -- and rate your confidence levels for this decision.
</p>

<h3>1. How to read a tweet? </h3>

<p>
1.1 <strong>Read all the information</strong> and read all the sentences and expressions (hashtags, emojis,
punctuations, other creative expressions of using words/characters/symbols) <strong>as a whole</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
When you see a tweet contains [PHOTO], [VIDEO], or [LINK], this means the tweet has &quot;embedded content&quot; --
including multimedia content (photos, videos, etc.) or a URL linking to external information (news articles,
blogs, etc.). We have removed such embedded information to help you <u>focus on the present text</u>. You should answer
the questions without seeing the embedded content.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When you see a tweet contains @Username, this means that this tweet is in conversations with another Twitter
user with this Username. Some of the user names belong to a public figure and can be recognized (e.g.,
@realDonalTrump is the president, @repXXX refers to representatives, @senateXXX refers to senators). You have to
pay attention to @Username, in order to know the tweet, in some cases, is in conversation with specific persons.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When you see a tweet contains #Hashtag, you need to take hashtags as part of the tweet content. Usually,
hashtags situate the tweet discussion in relevant contexts and may be used to express a particular idea, claim,
or slogan that calls to action.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
1.2. Interpret the message <strong>from the author&#39;s (Twitter user&#39;s) view</strong>
</p>
<p>
You will determine whether <strong><i>Care/Harm</i></strong> is conveyed in a Tweet from the Tweet author&#39;s perspective, not from the
perspective of the readers or of yourself.
</p>
<p>
Some tweets are sarcasm, meaning that the tweet expresses something in a mocking way so everyone else knows it
means the opposite. When you see sarcasm in a tweet, interpret what the author intended to say, e.g., when the
author said &quot;no harm&quot; sarcastically, s/he intended to say &quot;harm.&quot;
</p>

<h3>2. What is <strong><i>Care/Harm</i></strong>?</h3>

<p>
The <strong><i>Care/Harm</i></strong> is a moral intuition that involves care for others, generosity,
compassion, ability to feel the pain of others, sensitivity to the suffering of others, prohibiting actions that
harm others. People use this intuition to judge if someone/something is
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Caring</i></strong> -- that someone/something prevents or alleviates harm and care for others.
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Harmful</i></strong> -- that someone/something causes pain and suffering, or
</p>
<p>
Tweets talking about <strong><i>Care</i></strong> may
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>refer to or suggest (by the tweet author) something that is caring (e.g., empathy, sympathy, compassion,
generosity) or someone who acts to care for others (e.g., protect, pray for the victims of guns, advocates
solutions to prevent harm or increase safety, call for leaders or the public to act for preventing harm), or
something is being cared (e.g., saved)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have to do with an actions/solutions that aim to prevent harm or increase safety (e.g., a bill aims at
disarming hate, prevent violence, enhance safety net by a background check);</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tweets talking about <strong><i>Harm</i></strong> may
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>refer to or suggest (by the tweet author) something (e.g., weapons, gun violence, shooting, mass shooting,
hate) or someone (e.g., bad guys, thugs, terrorists, shooter, persons under FBI watch list) that does or may
do harm to someone (e.g., victim)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have to do with actions/solutions/policies that (1) may do harm or (2) may not be helpful in preventing harm</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. How a tweet is associated with <strong><i>Care/Harm</i></strong>?</h3>

<p>
Some tweets may only focus on <strong><i>Care</i></strong>, some only focus on <strong><i>Harm</i></strong>,
others may concern about both <strong><i>Care &amp; Harm</i></strong>. See examples in 5.
</p>
